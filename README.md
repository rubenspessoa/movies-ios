# Movies App

In order to run this project, make sure to complete the following steps:

1) Open the Movies.xcworkspace file in Xcode.
2) Run it on a device's simulator of your choice.

Despite of this project makes use of Cocoapods libraries, I included the needed ones in this repository. Thus, it's not required to run the 'pod install' command once again.
